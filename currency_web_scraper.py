'''This function scrapes conversion rates between GBP(Â£) and some of the most common currencies in the world. The function takes two 
arguments: 'gbp' which can be a float or integar that notates the amount in gbp that we are wanting to convert to a different currency, 
and 'currency' which is the currency that the amount in gbp is to be converted to.'''
