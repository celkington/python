This program simulates a transaction with an ATM machine. If the user decides to 
withdraw money from their bank account, they are given the option to enter the 
withdrawal amount in a foreign currency. The program will grab the most updated 
currency exchange figures and return the amount remaining in the bank account 
in GBP.
