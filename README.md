# password_creator
This is a function that prompts the user to create a password. The password must consist of at least 8 characters, 
contain at least one lowercase letter

contain at least one special character.

The user will then be prompted to re-enter their selected password to verify that the password was typed in correctly. 

This function will need to be edited later on to include an upper length limit to the password as well
as well as ensuring that the password is stored into a relational database upon successful password verification.
